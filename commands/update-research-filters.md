description: Interactively update filter criteria to improve digest relevance
---

Use the `update-research-filters` skill to refine your filter configuration based on actual digest results.

This command will:
1. Show you sample papers from a recent filtered digest
2. Ask which papers are still irrelevant to your work
3. Help you identify patterns in what should be filtered
4. Extract keywords and topics to add to your filter criteria
5. Update your config.yaml with improved filters
6. Optionally re-run the filter to show improved results

Run this command when `/filter-research-digest` still leaves too many irrelevant papers. It's iterative - you may need to run it 2-3 times to get filtering just right.
