description: Filter research digest to show only business-relevant papers
---

Use the `filter-research-digest` skill to remove irrelevant papers from a research digest.

This command will:
1. Ask which digest you want to filter (today's, last Sunday's, or specify a date)
2. Apply your configured filter criteria to remove irrelevant papers
3. Create a filtered version of the digest with only relevant papers
4. Show statistics on how many papers were removed

Especially useful for Sunday digests which can have 200-300 papers from Google Scholar.

If the filtered result still has too many irrelevant papers, run `/update-research-filters` to refine your criteria.
